Do not gamble on earnings! Use a legitimate strategy!,1my1ufb,na91249,"I always enjoy placing a bunch of Hail Mary low ball buy limit orders on good companies on earnings day, based on whatever the implied volatility is.

Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,naa2ns8,"You're missing the mark. Very misleading to treat insider sales such as Jensen Huang’s sales as a bearish signal. Firstly, his sales are pre-scheduled, not discretionary: All of Huang’s recent sales are part of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan set up back in March 2025. These plans don't allow him to time the market. [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp) . Sales since March also only represent a tiny fraction of his stake. He’s sold almost 2M of the 6M shares approved for sale so far this summer; however, he still holds \~73M. Even if he maxes out the 6M share plan, that’s under 8% of his holdings. He’s still massively exposed to NVDA for the long haul. Huang has also sold shares before (2020, 2021, etc.), and the stock kept climbing afterwards. As far as founder CEO holdings go, Jensen holds a massive stake in his company relative to many of his founder CEO peers.  It's important to recognize that these are *planned* sales, not *reactionary sales.*",11,Datsyuk131313,2025-08-23 17:35:39,positive

Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,naa0x0q,"Insider trading is not just when employees sell their shares because they “know something.” The real issue is when a person uses information that has not yet been made public to profit on the stock market. Imagine you work for a company and you already know that tomorrow it will announce very poor results, but the wider public is unaware. If you decide to sell your shares today in order to avoid a loss, that is insider trading, because you are acting on information that is not available to everyone else.  For this reason companies introduce strict rules, called blackout periods. Employees, especially managers, cannot simply buy or sell whenever they like. In the weeks before results or major announcements, trading is strictly forbidden. They are usually only allowed to trade in limited windows, typically just after the company has published its financial results, when all investors have the same knowledge. Senior executives often need to set up pre-planned selling schemes so that no one can claim they are taking unfair advantage.",5,kRoy_03,2025-08-23 17:26:32,negative

Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,naa1239,"Jensen Huang owns 3% of the company.   He registered months ago to sell $750M or so of stock.  That's equivalent to .02% of the company, or .5% of his holdings.  It's meaningless, find something better to worry about",5,norcalnatv,2025-08-23 17:27:16,positive
Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,naa0ss6,If you look at the total number of shares Jensen holds you can surmise this is not a bail of his position. It’s most likely due to the market needing more shares in circulation and Jensen acquiring more personal liquidity for his personal desires.,2,Bad-Tacotruck,2025-08-23 17:25:55,positive

Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,nab6dgx,It does kinda allow him to time the market. He sets a price at which he sells the stock at. I believe he's sold at 181.   So... it would SEEM as though he's only selling over 180.,1,Upstairs_Whole_580,2025-08-23 21:07:58,positive
Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,nacz3ve,Jensen is getting old. He basically needs to start selling now if he ever plans to actually be able to do something with his massive gains.,1,rydan,2025-08-24 04:07:18,positive
Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,nab6zad,".... it's bounded. It's bounded by the number of chips they can produce, it's bounded by the delays to several major projects, but right now the biggest issue is it's bounded by the Chinese market.  Hopefully they get B30 approval, but... there are some VERY optimistic price targets on the stock that... are pretty unlikely to be realized.",1,Upstairs_Whole_580,2025-08-23 21:11:25,negative

Nvidia insider selling stock pile,1my754a,nacab98,"No worries about being a novice.  Jensen sells off the same number of shares every few days.  He's worth over $150B and I'm guessing he's sold off around 1% of his shares over the past 3 years.  Personally, I'd sell off even more, but I'm not Jensen.",2,max2jc,2025-08-24 01:12:53,positive
